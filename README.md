## Dev Parks Demo

The idea for the demo of this talk is - we are going to build the fictional theme park that has parks and rides based on the technology. (For e.g Javascript World park has Angular Adventures, Happy Vue Valley, etc).

### Parks

### Rides

</p>

## GraphQL

The backend .NET core server is integrated with GraphQL.NET library.  You can run and hit the GraphQL playground (https://localhost:5001/playground) and play with graphql. The backend storage is cosmosdb.
